### ðŸ’» Some of my pet-projects:

| Project name | Description | What was used in the project |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| [Movies Catalog](https://github.com/daviddovzhanskiy/movies-catalog) | The site is a catalog for finding movies, TV series, actors, and so on. It includes several different features, such as - description of films / TV series; availability of a trailer for viewing a movie or TV series you are interested in; basic information about an actor or director you are interested in; when viewing information about an actor/ producer or other person from the film industry, three interesting facts from the life of a person you are interested in are also available as additional information. | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, API, Fetch, Async/Await, DOM |
| [The Shy Portfolio](https://github.com/daviddovzhanskiy/react-the-shy-portfolio) | A portfolio site that provides basic information about the person to whom it is dedicated, as well as about the projects he has made. It includes a section of ready-made projects that you can explore and go to his repository (if there is one), convenient navigation through sections, separate sections with information about the skills of a specialist and information with his contact details. | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, React Router Dom, React Hooks, React Components & Props |
| [Brain Cards](https://github.com/daviddovzhanskiy/brain-cards) | Online simulator in the form of a game for learning words in a foreign language. The simulator has a basic set of categories with words for learning English words, by users who are native speakers of Russian. The functionality of this simulator allows you to expand the knowledge base by creating your own categories, with which the user will be able to study even narrowly focused topics. Also, it is worth considering that the simulator, in addition to learning English, is focused on learning absolutely any foreign language and it does not matter which language the user is a native speaker of. Absolutely any combination of word pairs can be created using a wide range of functionality. For example, in the created category anyone can make pairs of words: Spanish-Russian; Italian-Russian; German-French; Chinese-Arabic and so on, absolutely any combination of word pairs. | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, API, Glitch, Fetch, Async/Await, DOM |
